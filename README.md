<!-- - While creating a `new post` `anonymous post` creations are `handled` by using the `bad-words package` of npm. Still it does not cover all the bad words but can `bypass` some of them. Its a `request` for all the `users` using this platform to `take care of the words` they use while `creating a post`. -->
