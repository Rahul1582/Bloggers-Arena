### Features and Functionalities üòÉ:-

- This is a Fully Functioning Blogging Website with `User Authentication` And `Authorization`.

- Here Users Can see `all the Posts` posted in this Website `without registering` themselves and `even without logging` in to the` Website`.

- In Order to write a `New Post`, the User has to `get registered themselves first` if they are using this platform for first time or directly `login` if they had `registered themselves previously`.

- After logging in the `User` can `Write a post, Update an Existing Post , Search posts by Author Name` ,`View its created posts`.

<!-- - While creating a `new post` `anonymous post` creations are `handled` by using the `bad-words package` of npm. Still it does not cover all the bad words but can `bypass` some of them. Its a `request` for all the `users` using this platform to `take care of the words` they use while `creating a post`. -->

- `Once` a `User logs in` you are good to go and Whenever the user `next time visits this website` the user is `not reqiuired to log in Again`.

- This Application is using `MongoDB Atlas's` free Cloud Service as the `Database Service`.
